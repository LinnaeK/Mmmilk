#Mmmilk

In a world where breastfeeding used to be the default method of feeding a young child, we now find ourselves with options on how to feed our child. While the WHO (World Health Organization) recommends breastfeeding for the first two years of life, various obstacles to breatfeeding and the availability of formula have led to only a percentage of children actually receiving that care. This app lets you explore the world and see, through graph representation, which countries have high (and low) rates of breastfeeding for differnt age ranges.
